# Brighter

**Brighter provides you a ability to control your screen brightness.**

Because this is just a prototype version, you need to ensure that the destination in the script is fit for your
machine. For example, my machine is powered by Intel so my destination would be `intel_brightness`.

If it doesn't fit your system, just change that and use it as you want to.

**Installation:**

 Now you can just clone the repo and move the binary (`brighter`) to your bin directory (for example /usr/bin).

**Usage:**

 - `brighter 100` this will directly set the brightness of the screen.
 - `brighter +100` this will increase the brightness of the screen with the given number.
-  `brighter -100` this will decrease the brightness of the screen with the given number.
