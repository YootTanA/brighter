# Brighter

Brighter provides you a ability to control your screen brightness.

Now you can just clone the repo and move the binary to your bin directory (for example /usr/bin).
Because this is just a prototype version, you need to ensure that the destination in the script is fit for your
machine. For example, my machine is powered by Intel, so, my destination would be `intel_brightness`.

If it don't fit your system, just change that and use it as you want to.
